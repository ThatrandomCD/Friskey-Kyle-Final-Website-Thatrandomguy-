<h2>About</h2>
	
	<h4>Hi my name is Kyle Friskey (AKA Thatrandomguy) and I am currently a student at DCCC for Graphic Design. I have some knowledge with Adobe illustrator, Photoshop, In-design, and Dreamweaver. The reason I choose to be a graphic desgin and an artist in general is that I want to get my ideas out there for people to see. All that I want to do share my creative vision, I am trying to get them out of my head and on the page. If want to consider me for job, I provide some stregnth and weaknesses that could help with showing how I work.</h4>
